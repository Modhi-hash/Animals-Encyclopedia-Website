  <h1>Cheetah</h1>

  <p>
    The cheetah is a large cat and the fastest land animal. 
    It has tawny to creamy white or pale buff fur marked with black spots. 
    Adults weigh 21–65 kg (46–143 lb) and can run 93–104 km/h. 
    It lives in savannahs, arid mountain ranges, and desert terrain. 
    Males mark territory by clawing trees and rolling in grass. 
    When separated, males call with “yipps” and “churrs” until reunited. 
    Females also call to locate cubs.
