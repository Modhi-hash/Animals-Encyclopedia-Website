  <h1>Lion</h1> 

  <p>
    The lion is one of the most famous wild animals,
    often called the “King of the Jungle”, although it
    usually lives in grasslands and savannas rather than forests.
    It belongs to the cat family and is the second largest big cat 
    after the Siberian tiger. Lions have strong bodies, loud roars that 
    can be heard from miles away, and they live in groups called prides,
    usually led by a dominant male. Female lions do most of the hunting, 
    while males protect the group. Lions are symbols of strength and 
    courage in many cultures, but they are now threatened by habitat loss 
    and illegal hunting.
