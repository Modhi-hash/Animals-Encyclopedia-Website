  <h1>Rabbit</h1>

  <p>
    A rabbit is a small, long-eared,
    herbivorous mammal known for its powerful hind legs 
    and short tail, belonging to the family Leporidae. 
    These social animals live in underground tunnels
    called warrens and are characterized by their
    constantly growing teeth, which are worn down by chewing
    fibrous plants like grass and hay. The ancestor of all
    domestic breeds is the European rabbit, which has been
    introduced to many parts of the world.
