  <h1>Tiger</h1>
  
  <p>
    The tiger is one of the most famous and 
    powerful big cats. It belongs to the cat family like the
    lion and is known for its strong, flexible body and 
    distinctive coat with black stripes on an orange or golden 
    background, which helps it camouflage while hunting.
    Tigers usually live in dense forests and grasslands and 
    are nocturnal predators that hunt alone. Their diet mainly 
    includes deer, wild boars, monkeys, and sometimes smaller
    animals. Tigers are symbols of strength and courage in many 
    cultures, but they are now threatened by habitat loss and
    poaching.
