  <h1>Wolf</h1>
  
  <p>
    The wolf, also known as the grey wolf, is a highly social and territorial animal. 
    Wolves are carnivores that hunt large prey such as wild ungulates, 
    but they may also feed on smaller animals and carrion. 
    They live in packs and are skilled cooperative hunters. 
    Wolves have long interacted with humans, sometimes feared and hunted, 
    yet respected in other cultures. Most recorded wolf attacks on humans 
    are linked to rabid animals.
