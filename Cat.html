  <h1>Cat</h1>

  <p>
    The cat (<i>Felis catus</i>), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, 
    is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species 
    of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that 
    the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. 
    It is commonly kept as a pet and working cat.
